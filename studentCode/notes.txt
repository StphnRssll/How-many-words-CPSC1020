clocking out at 2:45 am
if you compile and run, everytime you give it input it prints 2 words as it 
should and then it fucks up and doesn't print anything else correctly. it might
have something to do with the global vars

of course you also have ot make the make file and make the game work with
other files and check for freed memory and check if a user has entered a word
twice and things like that. find office hours.
